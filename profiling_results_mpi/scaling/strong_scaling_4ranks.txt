Creating a 2x2 process grid for 4 processes
Domain decomposition: Global size = 500x500, Process grid = 2x2
Rank 0 has local domain size 250x250 starting at global position (0,0)
Rank 0 neighbors: N=-2, E=1, S=2, W=-2
Rank 3 has local domain size 250x250 starting at global position (250,250)
Rank 3 neighbors: N=1, E=-2, S=-2, W=2
Rank 1 has local domain size 250x250 starting at global position (250,0)
Rank 1 neighbors: N=-2, E=-2, S=3, W=0
Rank 2 has local domain size 250x250 starting at global position (0,250)
Rank 2 neighbors: N=0, E=3, S=-2, W=-2
