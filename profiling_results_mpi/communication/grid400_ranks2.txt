Running benchmark with grid size 400x400 for 100 iterations across 1 runs using 2 MPI ranks (no output)

=== Run 1 of 1 ===
Creating a 2x1 process grid for 2 processes

=== Run 1 of 1 ===
Rank 1 has local domain size 400x200 starting at global position (0,200)
Rank 1 neighbors: N=0, E=-2, S=-2, W=-2
Domain decomposition: Global size = 400x400, Process grid = 2x1
Rank 0 has local domain size 400x200 starting at global position (0,0)
Rank 0 neighbors: N=-2, E=-2, S=1, W=-2
