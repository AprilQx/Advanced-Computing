Running benchmark with grid size 100x100 for 100 iterations across 1 runs using 2 MPI ranks (no output)

=== Run 1 of 1 ===
Creating a 2x1 process grid for 2 processes

=== Run 1 of 1 ===
Domain decomposition: Global size = 100x100, Process grid = 2x1
Rank 0 has local domain size 100x50 starting at global position (0,0)
Rank 0 neighbors: N=-2, E=-2, S=1, W=-2
Rank 1 has local domain size 100x50 starting at global position (0,50)
Rank 1 neighbors: N=0, E=-2, S=-2, W=-2
