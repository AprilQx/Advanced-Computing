Running benchmark with grid size 2000x2000 for 100 iterations across 1 runs using 2 MPI ranks (no output)

=== Run 1 of 1 ===
Creating a 2x1 process grid for 2 processes

=== Run 1 of 1 ===
Domain decomposition: Global size = 2000x2000, Process grid = 2x1
Rank 0 has local domain size 2000x1000 starting at global position (0,0)
Rank 0 neighbors: N=-1, E=-1, S=1, W=-1
Rank 1 has local domain size 2000x1000 starting at global position (0,1000)
Rank 1 neighbors: N=0, E=-1, S=-1, W=-1
